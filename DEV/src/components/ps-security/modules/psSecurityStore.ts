Since you've mentioned that there is no provided code for the AngularJS controller, I'm unable to scan through it to identify the state that needs to be handled by Redux. To proceed, I would need the specific AngularJS controller code or details about the state variables used within it. Please provide the necessary code or details so I can assist you effectively in creating the Redux store file.
