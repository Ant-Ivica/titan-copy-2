Since you've mentioned that there is no provided code for the AngularJS controller, I'm unable to identify any state that needs to be handled by Redux. To proceed, I would need the AngularJS controller code to analyze and extract the necessary state information for creating a Redux reducer file.

Please provide the AngularJS controller code or specify the state variables you want to manage with Redux, and I will help you create the appropriate reducer file.
