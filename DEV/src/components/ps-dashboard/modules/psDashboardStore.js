Since you've mentioned that there is no provided code for the AngularJS controller, I'm unable to identify any specific state that needs to be handled by Redux. To proceed, I would need the actual AngularJS controller code to analyze and extract the necessary state information.

If you can provide the AngularJS controller code, I can help generate the appropriate Redux store file based on the states used in that controller. Please provide the code or further details so I can assist you effectively.
