Since you've mentioned that there is no provided code for the AngularJS controller, I'm unable to identify any state that needs to be handled by Redux. To proceed, please provide the AngularJS controller code or specify the states you are aware of that need to be managed by Redux. This will enable me to generate the appropriate Redux store file for you.
