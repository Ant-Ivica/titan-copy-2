Since you've mentioned that there is no code provided for the AngularJS controller, I'm unable to scan through and identify the state that needs to be handled by Redux. To proceed, please provide the AngularJS controller code or specify the state variables you are aware of that need to be managed by Redux. This will enable me to generate the appropriate actions file for you.
